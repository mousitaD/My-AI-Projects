Project Title  - Breast Cancer Detection using Machine Learning
Short Description - The project aims to develop a predictive model to classify breast tumors as malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous) using patient data. The model can help in early detection and improve treatment outcomes.
Problem statement - Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers among women worldwide. Early detection is crucial for increasing survival rates. The problem is to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify breast tumors based on features such as cell size, shape, and other diagnostic measurements.
Dataset used - Link: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic)

Description: The dataset contains 569 samples with 30 features each (mean, standard error, and worst of various cell characteristics) and a target label (Malignant = 1, Benign = 0).
Libraries / Frameworks Used:

      Python Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

      Optional Deep Learning: TensorFlow / Keras (for neural network implementation)

      Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn
Data Loading & Exploration

  Load the dataset and check for missing values.

  Analyze class distribution (malignant vs benign).

Data Preprocessing

  Encode categorical variables if needed.

  Scale features using StandardScaler.

Feature Selection (Optional)

  Use correlation or feature importance to reduce dimensionality.

Model Selection & Training

  Split dataset into train and test sets (e.g., 80:20).

  Train models using KNN

Evaluation

Evaluate models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.
